description: Extracts building hierarchy (levels, zones, equipment) from BMS web interfaces. Produces an Excel workbook (.xlsx) for Peak platform import with page source evidence. Triggers for "extract from BMS", "map BMS hierarchy", "BMS site structure", or "extract BMS for Peak".
---

## Workflow Overview

```
1. SETUP      → Collect BMS URL + site name, create output directory
2. AUTH       → Navigate to BMS, handle login if needed
3. SCOPE      → Ask user for URL guidance (floor plans, equipment pages)
4. DISCOVER   → Identify nav tree pattern using user-provided URLs
5. EXTRACT    → Two-pass: floor plans (levels & zones), then full equipment list
6. OUTPUT     → Run write_xlsx.py, write {site_name}_sitemodel.json, {site_name}_manifest.json
```

### Progress checklist

Use this to track extraction progress:

- [ ] SETUP — output directory created
- [ ] AUTH — authenticated and on BMS dashboard
- [ ] SCOPE — user provided URL guidance
- [ ] DISCOVER — nav pattern identified
- [ ] EXTRACT Part A — floor plans done, levels & zones captured
- [ ] EXTRACT Part B — full equipment list complete
- [ ] OUTPUT — xlsx + JSON files written

---

## Step 1: SETUP

Ask the user for:
1. **BMS URL** — the web interface URL
2. **Site name** — human-readable name (e.g. "99 Elizabeth St")

Create the output directory: `<site-name-kebab>/`

---

## Step 2: AUTH

**CRITICAL: Never ask the user to type credentials into the chat. Never write credentials to output files.**

1. Navigate to the BMS URL
2. Read the page — if it shows the BMS dashboard, skip to Step 3
3. If it shows a login page, tell the user:
   > "The BMS login page is showing. Please log in using the Chrome browser tab. Let me know once you're on the dashboard."
4. Wait for confirmation, then re-read to verify

**Note:** The browser tab doesn't always pop up automatically — the user may need to find it in their browser tabs.

### Browser tab setup

Before executing JavaScript on a BMS page:
1. Call `tabs_context_mcp(createIfEmpty: true)` to initialize
2. Call `tabs_create_mcp` to create a new tab — use this tab ID for all work
3. Navigate to the BMS URL, wait 5 seconds for render
4. If page reads fail, create another new tab and retry

---

## Step 3: SCOPE — User-Guided URL Discovery

After authentication, **ask the user before exploring**:

> "I'm authenticated. To extract efficiently, can you help me with:
> 1. **Levels & zones** — what URL(s) should I look at for floor plans or level navigation?
> 2. **Equipment list** — what URL(s) should I look at for equipment summaries? (e.g., AHU summary, chiller plant)
>
> You can share links or describe where to find them in the BMS navigation."

Wait for the user to respond before proceeding.

---

## Step 4: DISCOVER — Identify Navigation Structure

Navigate to user-provided URLs. Read pages and use Execute JavaScript to extract DOM elements, especially from iframes.

**Read `references/bms-ui-patterns.md`** for platform-specific guidance on navigation, hierarchy, and common gotchas.

### What to identify

- **Nav pattern** — sidebar tree, top tabs, button grid, or breadcrumb-based
- **Level/zone structure** — how levels and zones appear in the hierarchy
- **Direct URLs** — whether each level/zone has a navigable URL
- **Equipment summary pages** — where to find comprehensive equipment lists

**Iframe handling:** Many BMS platforms load content in iframes. If Read page returns limited content, navigate directly to the iframe URL.

---

## Step 5: EXTRACT — Two-Pass Extraction

### Part A: Floor Plan Extraction (builds levels_and_zones)

For each level:
1. Navigate to the level's floor plan / graphics page
2. Read page + Execute JavaScript (`document.documentElement.outerHTML`) to extract equipment names
3. Save page source to `level-<slug>.html`
4. Record `source_url` — the page URL where equipment was found
5. Extract equipment names — look for all equipment labels on the graphic
6. **Derive zone IDs** — strip the equipment type prefix:
   - `VAV_P1` → zone `P1`, `FCU_G_1` → zone `G_1`, `PAU_11_1` → zone `11_1`
7. Build zone list — always prepend "Plantroom, All", then append unique zone IDs

**Zone derivation rule:** Equipment names follow `{TYPE}_{ZoneID}` or `{TYPE}_{Level}_{ZoneID}`. Strip the known type prefix to get the zone. Deduplicate across equipment sharing the same zone.

**Default rows:**
- A "Plantroom" level with equipments=`default`, zones=`Plantroom, All`, source_url=`default`
- Levels without floor plan equipment still get zones=`Plantroom, All`

### Part B: Full Equipment List (builds equipment_list)

Browse summary/plant/overview pages to find ALL equipment:

1. Navigate to each equipment summary page
2. Read page + Execute JavaScript to extract equipment names
3. For each item, record:
   - **`equipment_name`** — BMS name (e.g., `Chiller_1`, `HR_CZN_AHU`)
   - **`level_select`** — assign to a level from Part A, or create new (e.g., "Plantroom", "Roof")
   - **`zone_select`** — assign to a zone from the level's zone list
   - **`equipment_type_select`** — classify using `references/equipment-types.md`
   - **`source_url`** — the page URL where found
4. Floor-plan equipment from Part A also gets rows here

**Note on screenshots:** In CoWork, browser screenshots cannot be saved to the filesystem (Chrome extension is sandboxed). Rely on saved page source (HTML) as the persistent artifact.

### Build the structure as you go

Maintain a running JSON site model during extraction. See `references/output-format.md` for the full schema and example.

### Progress reporting

After each level/page:
> "Extracted Ground floor: found 3 VAVs, 3 FCUs, 1 PAU → 6 zones. Moving to Level 1..."

---

## Step 6: OUTPUT — Write Files

### 6a. `{site_name}_assetregister.xlsx` — Excel Workbook

Write `{site_name}_sitemodel.json` first, then generate the workbook:

```bash
pip install openpyxl -q
python references/write_xlsx.py <output_dir>
```

The workbook has 3 tabs: `levels_and_zones`, `equipment_list`, `equipment_types`. See `references/output-format.md` for column specs and examples.

### 6b. `{site_name}_sitemodel.json`

Write the complete JSON structure built during extraction.

### 6c. `{site_name}_manifest.json`

Write extraction metadata (source URL, site name, platform, timestamps, counts).

### Final summary

Report to the user:
> **Extraction complete for [Site Name]**
> - Levels: N | Zones: Z | Equipment: M
> - Output: `<site-name>/`
> - Files: `{site_name}_assetregister.xlsx`, `{site_name}_sitemodel.json`, `{site_name}_manifest.json`, page source HTMLs

## Troubleshooting

### Browser tab not visible
Tell the user to look for the Chrome browser tab.

### JS errors ("Cannot access chrome-extension:// URL")
Create a fresh tab with `tabs_create_mcp` and use that tab ID.

### Network blocked
If the BMS IP/domain is blocked, add it under settings → "Additional allowed domains".

### Tool errors (Click, Execute JavaScript)
Navigate to a page first and wait for load. If errors persist, create a new tab and retry.

### BMS content in iframes
If Read page returns limited content, check for iframes and navigate directly to the iframe URL.

### Can't identify levels vs zones
Ask the user to clarify:
> "I can see these nodes in the navigation. Which ones are levels and which are zones?"
